This repository demonstrates a subtle but significant issue with the `IsEmpty` function in VBScript when used with Variant variables containing empty strings.  The `bug.vbs` file shows the problematic code, while `bugSolution.vbs` presents a robust solution that correctly handles various input scenarios including null, empty string, and other values.  The problem stems from the fact that `IsEmpty` considers empty strings as not empty, leading to potential runtime errors or unexpected program flow.  The provided solution ensures thorough input validation and appropriate handling of all possible scenarios.
